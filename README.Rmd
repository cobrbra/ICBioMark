# ICBioMark

<!-- badges: start -->

Welcome to ICBioMark. Based on the paper "Data-driven design of targeted gene panels forestimating immunotherapy biomarkers", *Bradley and Cannings* (currently being written [here](https://github.com/cobrbra/TargetedPanelEstimation_Paper)), ICBioMark is designed to implement regularised optimisation methods for the design and use of targeted gene panels in predicting immunotherapeutic biomarkers such as Tumour Mutation Burden (TMB) and Tumour Indel Burden (TIB).

## Installation

<!-- You can install the development version of ICBioMark from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
You can install the development version of this package from this github repository (using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package) with:

``` r
devtools::install_.packages_github("cobrbra/ICBioMark")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ICBioMark)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
